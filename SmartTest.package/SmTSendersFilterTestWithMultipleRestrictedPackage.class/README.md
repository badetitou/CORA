I test the strategy SendersFinder with the filter RestrictedPackage.
The filter should accept any test that is owned by a package whose name matches the regex.

Here we look for tests in the package SmartDataTestOutsideP1 AND SmartDataTestOutsideP2  End of statement list encountered ->(this is defined in the SetUp method).
The results are different than the results with only one package.
